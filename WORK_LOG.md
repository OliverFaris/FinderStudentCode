Right now I am trying to get a better understanding of the problem set. I do remember from class you were talking to David and I about it and we basically need make a data structure with constant lookup times. |

Tries basically have constant lookup times but I'm not sure how to make tries have a key value relationship since right now I feel like you can only lookup something in a trie and just see if it exists or not. I think I meant TSTs by the way. When I put all the keys in the TST, how will I know what they're values are?? |
| Nov 2 | 10:00pm-11:00pm | I think I might have solution to the problem above. Maybe once you get to the end of a key, you have a string that says the value. I think this has potential to work but honestly I don't know if this takes full advantage of a TST like the dictionary did. I think a TST worked with the dictionary well since after each node, it eliminates a lot of possibilities since the words in a dictionary aren't that far apart in spelling from word to word if that makes sense. But in this case, I feel like after each node, the TST doesn't get rid of a ton of possibilities since our data sets might have very different spellings and stuff. |

The main thing behind my idea is that if we can turn the keys into numbers, then we can just use a simple array... right? I do see some problems with this though. First, the hashes probably won't be evenly spaced out at all and will probably just waste a lot of space in the array since a lot of indecies will have nothing in them. In retrospect this just seems like a really bad idea. |

Then, in build table, I will insert all the data into the data structure instance. Finally, in query, I will search in the data structre and retrieve the value of the key inputted. How to do all this? My best guess is a TST but I'm really curious for what we will learn in class. Would we basically make a hashmap from scratch or something completely unrelated? |
